## Important Things

### Disclaimer:TkIDE is <b><b>NOT</b></b> pure tkinter. There are custom classes amd in the future there may be some wxPython or PyQt
<br>

also it is not an ide its just a trash code editor with a few features. 

### Info

- Will try to work on load times (not happening lol)
    > On the previous note, numba might be used in the future.
    > On that note, I might now use pyjion as an attempt to speed it up.
- more features - maybe?
- Updated yearly for major updates.
-  Usually updated monthly for minor updates.
- The tab system is not perfect and will probably be improved in the future.
    > If too many tabs are open the close buttons will clump togther and not work. A solution that could be implemented is to have a scrollbar for the tab system and fixing the custom tab system.
- The syntax highlighting is not perfect and will probably be improved in the future.
    > I need more experience with regex before I will try to fix it, - expect delay of 3 - 5 months.
- I am working on an extension system that will allow for smaller builds.
- I am working on a system to run python files and output them to a tkinter terminal.
    > Note:I might  on adding the terminal as input and output for a more intergrated experience.
- Running extension commands has a simple basis for now.
  > You can now add your own commands to the extension system via the extensions folder and commands.json. To run a command type the sections of the command in the command box separated by / and press the run button. All console related code will not work.



## ***Beware***
- ### **TkIDE** could be closed at any time.
